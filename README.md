# Brain-Tumor-MRI-Image-Classification
This project uses deep learning and transfer learning to classify MRI brain scans into glioma, meningioma, pituitary, or no tumor. A Streamlit web app enables real-time predictions, supporting early diagnosis in medical imaging.

🧠 Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based solution for classifying brain MRI images into multiple tumor categories. It involves building a custom CNN model from scratch and applying transfer learning techniques to enhance performance. Finally, the solution is deployed as a Streamlit web app to enable real-time predictions.
